# GitHub Linguist configuration
# Goal: make Python the dominant language by excluding notebooks and generated/docs assets from stats.

# Treat notebooks as documentation so they don't count toward language percentages
*.ipynb linguist-documentation

# Exclude built site from stats (MkDocs output)
site/** linguist-generated

# Exclude documentation content from stats
docs/** linguist-documentation
images/** linguist-documentation

# Keep explicit language hints for common extensions
*.sh linguist-language=Shell
*.md linguist-language=Markdown
*.json linguist-language=JSON
*.yml linguist-language=YAML
*.yaml linguist-language=YAML
*.py linguist-language=Python

# Ensure Python sources in uqdd/ are detectable (the default, but kept explicit for clarity)
