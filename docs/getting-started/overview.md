# Overview

This project accompanies the paper "Combining Bayesian and Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Improved Bioactivity Modelling".

Goals:
- Provide reproducible pipelines for preparing Papyrus++ subsets and training hybrid UQ models
- Benchmark hybrid approaches (EOE, EMC) against baselines
- Offer metrics analysis including calibration, probabilistic scoring, and decision utility

Datasets & Endpoints:
- Papyrus++ curated subsets
- Endpoints: xC50 and Kx

Highlights:
- EOE (Ensemble of Evidential networks) and EMC (Evidential MC Dropout)
- Baselines: deep ensembles, MC-Dropout, probabilistic neural networks
- Tools: PyTorch 2.0+, RDKit, scikit-learn, Weights & Biases

See the User Guide for data, models, configuration, and metrics.
