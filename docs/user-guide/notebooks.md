# Notebooks

Exploratory analysis notebooks are under `notebooks/`:

- `metrics_analysis.ipynb`: explore performance and calibration metrics; mirrors `scripts/metrics_analysis.py`.
- `metrics_analysis-kx.ipynb`: variant focused on Kx endpoint.
- `models_reassessment.ipynb`: reassess models across splits/targets and visualize comparative results; mirrors
  `scripts/model_reassessment.py`.

Use the scripts under `scripts/` for automated, reproducible runs.
